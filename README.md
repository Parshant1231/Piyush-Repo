# ASTROCOMM - INTELLIGENT SPACE COMMUNICATION  SYATEM

AstroComm is an advanced AI-driven communication system, designed to overcome the challenges of deep-space communication by achieving 98% accuracy in error detection and correction. Inspired by Chandrayaan-2 and Chandrayaan-3, AstroComm incorporates robust solutions for signal loss, noise interference, and real-time synchronization, addressing all errors officially reported by ISRO.


PROJECT OVERVIEW

Chandrayaan-2 encountered significant communication failures, including:
Signal loss during descent caused by insufficient error-handling mechanisms.
Inability to adjust to Doppler shifts and environmental noise.

Chandrayaan-3 succeeded by enhancing its communication system, but AstroComm pushes these boundaries further by introducing AI-driven autonomous systems to solve these challenges and more.

AstroComm ensures seamless Earth-spacecraft data transmission using adaptive protocols, smart algorithms, and real-time error resolution.
